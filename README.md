If you open a card in Design Depot, this will also open it locally in a new tab. That's it.

1. Download `pickaxe-ext.zip` and and extract it.
2. Visit chrome://extensions (via omnibox or menu -> Tools -> Extensions).
3. Enable Developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..." button.
5. Select the directory containing your unpacked extension.

- Click on the pickaxe icon to see a list of current pickaxe editor sessions.
- The `local` link will open the editor session in a new tab, while the `copy` link will copy the editor session url to your clipboard to use in other browsers, BrowserStack, etc.
- The session highlighted in blue is the one in the currently selected tab.
